<font size=4>	Responsible for control of the left side of the body, and is the more artistic and creative side of the brain  
<br>
	 Responsible for control of the right side of the body, and is the more academic and logical side of the brain</font>

		<h2>The Frontal Lobe of the Cerebrum</h2>
		<font size=3>You use your frontal lobe nearly everyday.
		You use it to make decisions, such as what to eat or drink for breakfast in the morning, as well as for thinking or studying for a test.
	The frontal lobe is also where our personality is formed and where we can carry out higher mental processes such as planning.
	In addition, the frontal lobe is necessary to being able to speak fluently (without fault) and meaningfully.</font>

<section><h2>The Temporal Lobe of the Cerebrum</h2>
<font size=2>The Temporal Lobe mainly revolves around hearing and selective listening.
It receives sensory information such as sounds and speech from the ears.
It is also key to being able to comprehend, or understand meaningful speech.
In fact, we would not be able to understand someone talking to us, if it wasn't for the temporal lobe.
This lobe is special because it makes sense of the all the different sounds and pitches (different types of sound) being transmitted from the sensory receptors of the ears.</font>

<section><h2>The Paretal Lobe of the Cerebrum</h2>
	<font size=3>The parietal lobe carries out some very specific functions.
	As a part of the cortex, it has a lot of responsibilities and has to be able to process sensory information within seconds.
	The parietal lobe is where information such as taste, temperature and touch are integrated, or processed.
 Humans would not be able to to feel sensations of touch, if the parietal lobe was damaged.</font>

<section> <h2>Occipital Lobe of the Cerebrum</h2>
<font size=2>	The occiptial lobe is important to being able to correctly understand what your eyes are seeing.
		These lobes have to be very fast to process the rapid information that our eyes are sending.
		 Similar to how the temporal lobe makes sense of auditory information, the occipital lobe makes sense of visual information so that we are able to understand it.
	 If our occipital lobe was impaired, or injured we would not be able to correctly process visual signals, thus visual confusion would result.</font>

<section><h2>The Thalmus</h2>
	<font size=3>The thalamus is similar to a doctor that diagnoses, or identifies, a patient's disease or sickness.
			It diagnoses different sensory information that is being transmitted to the brain including auditory (relating to hearing or sound), visual, tactile (relating to touch),  and gustatory (relating to taste) signals.
			 After that, it directs the sensory information to the different parts and lobes of the cortex.
	 If this part of the brain is damaged, all sensory information would not be processed and sensory confusion would result.</font>

	<section><h2>Cerebellum</h2>
<font>The cerebellum is one of the most identifiable parts of the brain due to its unique shape and location.
It is extremely important for being able to perform everyday voluntary (done with purpose and intent) tasks such as walking and writing.
It is also essential to being able to stay balanced and upright.
Patients who have suffered from damaged cerebellums often struggle with keeping their balance and maintaining proper muscle coordination.</font>
