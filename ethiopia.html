						<h2>crime in ethopia</h2>
					
						<font size="5">
							Overall, crime is generally opportunistic and non-violent/non-confrontational. Foreigners (called as “ferengis”) can be targeted for crimes, as it assumed that they possess valuables and are more susceptible to becoming victims. Pedestrians are targeted most for crimes such as pickpocketing, snatch-and-run thefts (including from occupied vehicles), and other petty crimes. These are generally not planned attacks and are against foreigners unaware of their surroundings. Petty crimes (pickpocketing, purse snatching, harassment by gangs of youths) occur randomly in Addis Ababa. These incidents occur anytime and are more common in areas where there are large numbers of pedestrians. Physical violence in these instances is uncommon but does happen on occasion.[osac.org]

						<font size="2">
							According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Ethiopia has the highest rate of traffic fatalities per vehicle in the world. Roads are poorly maintained, inadequately marked, and poorly lighted. Road travel after dark outside cities is dangerous and discouraged due to hazards posed by broken-down vehicles in the road, pedestrians, stray animals, and the possibility of armed robbery. Road lighting is inadequate at best and nonexistent outside of cities. Excessive speed, unpredictable local driving habits, pedestrians/livestock in the roadway, and the lack of adherence to basic safety standards for vehicles are daily hazards. Many vehicles are unlicensed, and many drivers lack basic driver training or insurance. Emergency services are limited or nonexistent in many parts of the country. Drivers should always carry spare tires, fuel, and tools on long trips, as there is no roadside assistance. U.S. government personnel must limit road travel outside towns or cities to daylight hours and travel in convoys, if possible, in case of breakdowns.[osac.gov]
